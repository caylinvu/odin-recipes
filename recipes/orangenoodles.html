        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is one of my favorite asian noodle dishes to make!!! It combines egg noodles, sliced beef, and snap peas with an orange marmalade teriyaki sauce for an explosion of flavors. It's easy to make and lasts several meals.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound beef boneless sirloin, cut into thin strips</li>
            <li>1 can (14 1/2 ounces) beef broth</li>
            <li>1/4 cup teriyaki stir-fry sauce</li>    
            <li>2 tablespoons orange marmalade</li>
            <li>dash of ground red pepper (cayenne)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups snap pea pods</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups uncooked fine egg noodles (3 ounces)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
